Dot TK's DomainShare program

This library allows you to integrate Dot TK's DomainShare API easily.

Dot TK DomainShare is used to register free .TK domain names for others. 
It's not only used by Internet hosting providers and Internet access 
providers to register unlimited free domain names for their customers, 
but also by a wide range of other software developers that use 
DomainShare within their applications.

You will need to signup for DomainShare before you can use the API.
